# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts house prices based on various features using Machine Learning. The model is trained using historical housing data and leverages regression techniques to provide accurate price estimates.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Training and Evaluation
- Price Prediction

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset consists of various features such as:
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Square footage
- Location
- Year built

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sinanmohammed4/House-Price-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd House-Price-Prediction
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Load the dataset.
3. Run the cells to train the model and predict house prices.

## Results
The trained model provides price predictions with reasonable accuracy. Performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score are used for evaluation.

## Contributing
Feel free to fork this repository and contribute by improving the model, adding new features, or optimizing the dataset.
